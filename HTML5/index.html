    <h3>About Bangalore</h3>
    <p>The cityâ€™s nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief,<mark> Kempe Gowda. </mark>
      The fort was reconstructed of stone in 1761. 
      Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881, when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; 
      <span style="background-color: yellow;"> Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973.</span></p>
